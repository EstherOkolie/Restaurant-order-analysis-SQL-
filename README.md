# Restaurant-order-analysis-SQL (PostgreSQL)

I undertook an SQL project to analyze a restaurant database using **PostgreSQL**.  
The analysis explores the restaurant’s **menu** and **order records** to understand pricing, categories, and ordering patterns.

## Analysis Covered
- Total number of menu items
- Minimum and maximum menu prices
- Number of dishes per category
- Average price per category
- Order date range
- Total number of orders and items ordered
- Orders with the highest number of items
- Orders with more than 12 items
